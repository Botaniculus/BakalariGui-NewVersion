# For Linux users:
To make it look native (GTK) you must add this to your ~/.profile file:

export _JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true -Dswing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKLookAndFeel -Dswing.crossplatformlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKLookAndFeel'

You can also download .run file, which is bash script with binary java payload. It has export _JAVA_OPTIONS=... in it.
